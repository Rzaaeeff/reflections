When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You may want to keep remote repository as a backup. But, when it comes to a 
    project where more than one people contribute, having remote one will make 
    things a lot easier. Also, you may want to make your repository public,
    which can be achieved with remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It's more convenient. For example, if there is a bug in a newer version,
	I would not pull until bug is fixed.
